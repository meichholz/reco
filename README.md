# Reco - a recoder frame

I already have an mp3 encoding script that can process a simple text form album
description and recode that cdparanoia tracks into tagged MP3 or OGG files.

It is meant to have a DRY description and implement some **useful** standards
on the file names. Namely, the files shall behave well on bad MP3 players.
Erm... they all are broken in the ways they handle file names (sorting,
displaying) so ... You have to take care of it.

Well, this project appears to be in some indefinite hiatus. Apologies here.

Probably the original skript is not bad enough ;-)

## More documentation

Since Github and Yard appear to have incompatible Markdown-Reference-Schemes
and no standard table syntax (even with github-markdown gem), the References
are given in a pure HTML table for (in-) convenience. Apologies.

<table>
<tr><td>About Building </td>
  <td><a href="BUILDING.md">github</a></td>
  <td><a href="file.BUILDING.html">local</a></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>A Project History </td>
  <td><a href="History.md">github</a></td>
  <td><a href="file.History.html">local</a></td>
</table>
